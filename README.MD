Objective:

This task of the assignment is to perform land use and land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. It involves a series of steps, starting from dataset acquisition to the implementation of a deep learning-based classification model, followed by a thorough analysis and visualization of the results.

To recreate the results I got in this assignment, run each cell of the notebook in order.
